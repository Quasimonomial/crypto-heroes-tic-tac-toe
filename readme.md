# CryptoHeroes Tic Tac Toe
###### (Green Dream Team Obviously)



### Getting started
1. run `npm install` to install node modules
2. run `ganache-cli` to run the test blockchain net, this lets us deploy and interact with contracts on `localhost`.
3. `truffle migrate` will migrate the `TicTacToe` contract to the test net.  Pay attention to the address it outputs
4. `truffle console` will open the truffle console and let you interact with the contract.
